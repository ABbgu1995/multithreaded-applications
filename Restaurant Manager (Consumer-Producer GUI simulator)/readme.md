# Restaurant Manager GUI Simulator

## Overview
This GUI application is designed to simulate a restaurant environment using the producer-consumer problem model. It features a thread-safe design to ensure smooth operation and avoid deadlocks.

## Features
- **Two Interactive Screens**: The application consists of two main screens, each designed for specific roles within the restaurant simulation.
- **Thread Safety**: Implements robust synchronization mechanisms to handle multiple threads without encountering deadlocks.
- **Dynamic Buffer Capacity**: Adjust the buffer capacity to fit the scenario needs, providing flexibility in simulation scale.
- **Statistics**: Includes at least four different statistics to track various aspects of restaurant operations.

## Usage
- **Screen 1**: Handles the producer operations, simulating the kitchen environment where meals are prepared.
- **Screen 2**: Manages the consumer operations, simulating the dining area where meals are served and consumed.
